How to localize scim-bridge.el

1. Copy a template file scim-bridge-XX.el

   ex. The target language is Chinese:

     $ cp scim-bridge-XX.el scim-bridge-zh.el

2. Replace some strings in the new file with appropriate ones

   "XX"              -> language code of target language
   "TARGET_LANGUAGE" -> target language
   "YEAR"            -> year
   "MM"              -> month
   "DD"              -> day
   "TRANSLATOR"      -> your name

3. Translate the commentary section

   Remember to replace "XX" with the string representing the target
   language.

4. Translate the documentation strings

   Refer to the original texts inserted in each entry as comments.
   If the string is left empty, the documentation string will
   remain original.

5. Translate the custom-type options

   Uncomment the options which are commented out, and then transcribe
   the tags in them into target language.

6. (Optional) Add function usefull for target language

   See scim-bridge-ja.el.
