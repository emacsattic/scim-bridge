;;; Commentary:

;; The Smart Common Input Method platform (SCIM) is an input
;; method (IM) platform containing support for more than thirty
;; languages (CJK and many European languages) for POSIX-style
;; operating systems including Linux and BSD.

;; scim-bridge.el is a SCIM-Bridge client for Emacs. It allows
;; users on-the-spot style input with SCIM. The input statuses are
;; individually kept for each buffer, and prefix-keys such as C-x
;; and C-c can be used even if SCIM is active. So you can input
;; various languages fast and comfortably by using it.

;; This program changes the documentation strings of the variables
;; and functions defined in scim-bridge.el into the equivalents
;; which are written in English.

;; This program is *not* a part of SCIM-Bridge.

;;
;; Requirements:
;;
;;  * GNU Emacs 22 or 23
;;  * SCIM-Bridge agent (Version 0.4.13 or later)
;;
;; Note that scim-mode works only when Emacs is running under X session.
;;

;;
;; Installation:
;;
;; First, save this file (scim-bridge-XX.el) and scim-bridge.el
;; in a directory listed in load-path, and then byte-compile them.
;;
;; Put the following in your .emacs file:
;;
;;   (require 'scim-bridge-XX)
;;   (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'scim-mode-on)
;;
;; To disable XIM in Emacs, put the following in ~/.Xresources:
;;
;;   Emacs*useXIM: false
;;
;; and restart X session or execute a shell command:
;;
;;   xrdb ~/.Xresources
;;
;;
;; Here is the example of settings in .emacs:
;;
;;   (require 'scim-bridge-XX)
;;   ;; Turn on scim-mode automatically after loading .emacs
;;   (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'scim-mode-on)
;;   ;; Use C-SPC for Set Mark command
;;   (scim-define-common-key ?\C-\s nil)
;;   ;; Use C-/ for Undo command
;;   (scim-define-common-key ?\C-/ nil)
;;   ;; Change cursor color depending on SCIM status
;;   (setq scim-cursor-color '("red" "blue" "limegreen"))
