;;; Commentary:

;; The Smart Common Input Method platform (SCIM) is an input
;; method (IM) platform containing support for more than thirty
;; languages (CJK and many European languages) for POSIX-style
;; operating systems including Linux and BSD.

;; scim-bridge.el is SCIM-Bridge client for GNU Emacs. It is,
;; however, not part of official SCIM-Bridge.

;; This program changes the documentation strings of the variables
;; and functions defined in scim-bridge.el into the equivalents
;; which are written in English.

;;
;; Installation:
;;
;; First, save this file (scim-bridge-XX.el) and scim-bridge.el
;; in a directory listed in load-path, and then byte-compile them.
;;
;; Put the following in your .emacs file:
;;
;;   (require 'scim-bridge-XX)
;;
;; After that, execute Emacs by typing on command line:
;;
;;   XMODIFIERS=@im=none emacs
;;
;; and turn on scim-mode:
;;
;;   M-x scim-mode
;;
;;
;; Here is the example of settings in .emacs:
;;
;;   (require 'scim-bridge-XX)
;;   ;; Turn on scim-mode automatically after loading .emacs
;;   (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'scim-mode-on)
;;   ;; Use C-SPC for Set Mark command
;;   (scim-define-common-key ?\C-\s nil)
;;   ;; Use C-/ for Undo command
;;   (scim-define-common-key ?\C-/ nil)
;;   ;; Change cursor color depending on SCIM status
;;   (setq scim-cursor-color '("red" "blue" "limegreen"))
;;
;;
;; Note that this program requires GNU Emacs 22 or later, and
;; doesn't work when Emacs is running on terminal emulator.
